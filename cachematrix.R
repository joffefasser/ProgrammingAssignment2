# Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the
# inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly. 
# The purpose of the functions defined in this file is to provide such caching support for working 
# with matrix inversion computations.

#' This function creates a poor manâ€™s cached matrix object by building a number of functions used for 
#' managing the user provided matrix structure along with a closure used for sharing object state 
#' among the functions. The object state contains the user provided matrix structure including the 
#' inverse calculation of this structure. 
#' @param x A square matrix. Is required to be invertible.
#' @return A list of functions sharing state by means of a closure.
#' @examples
#' makeCacheMatrix(matrix())
#' makeCacheMatrix()
#' a <- makeCacheMatrix(matrix(ncol=3, nrow=3))

#' This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
